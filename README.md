🙋🏽‍♂️ Hi, I'm j6s3

🚶🏽‍♂️ I'm starting with the topic of programming, conventional jobs no longer fill me, I want to dedicate myself to something that I like

📚 I'm currently learning Css, Html and Javascript, I have the basic knowledge and still learning little by little.

👀 I am looking to collaborate or work on a project without much pressure where I can continue learning these languages.

How to reach me.. cdnojc@gmail.com
